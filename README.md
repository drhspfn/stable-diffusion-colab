# stable-diffusion-colab

A small Notebook to use [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

The installation paths are pre-encrypted with the rle-method.  
Why the encryption? Google Colab closes your session (mine so far) when it notices `Stable Diffusion` etc. in the code cells.

Just open [colab_new.ipynb](https://github.com/drhspfn/stable-diffusion-colab/blob/main/colab_new.ipynb) Run both cells in turn, the second has some kind of interface, I think you can handle it
